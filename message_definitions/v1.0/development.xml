        <description>Request GCS control of a system (or of a specific component in a system).

          A controlled system should only accept MAVLink commands and command-like messages that are sent by its controlling GCS, or from other components with the same system id.
          Commands from other systems should be rejected with MAV_RESULT_FAILED (except for this command, which may be acknowledged with MAV_RESULT_ACCEPTED if control is granted).
          Command-like messages should be ignored (or rejected if that is supported by their associated protocol).

          GCS control of the whole system is managed via a single component that we will refer to here as the "system manager component".
          This component streams the CONTROL_STATUS message and sets the GCS_CONTROL_STATUS_FLAGS_SYSTEM_MANAGER flag.
          Other components in the system should monitor for the CONTROL_STATUS message with this flag, and set their controlling GCS to match its published system id.
          A GCS that wants to control the system should also monitor for the same message and flag, and address the MAV_CMD_REQUEST_OPERATOR_CONTROL to its component id.
          Note that integrators are required to ensure that there is only one system manager component in the system (i.e. one component emitting the message with GCS_CONTROL_STATUS_FLAGS_SYSTEM_MANAGER set).

          The MAV_CMD_REQUEST_OPERATOR_CONTROL command is sent by a GCS to the system manager component to request or release control of a system, specifying whether subsequent takeover requests from another GCS are automatically granted, or require permission.

          The system manager component should grant control to the GCS if the system does not require takeover permission (or is uncontrolled) and ACK the request with MAV_RESULT_ACCEPTED.
          The system manager component should then stream CONTROL_STATUS indicating its controlling system: all other components with the same system id should monitor this message and set their own controlling GCS to match that of the system manager component.

          If the system manager component cannot grant control (because takeover requires permission), the request should be rejected with MAV_RESULT_FAILED.
          The system manager component should then send this same command to the current owning GCS in order to notify of the request.
          The owning GCS would ACK with MAV_RESULT_ACCEPTED, and might choose to release control of the vehicle, or re-request control with the takeover bit set to allow permission.
          In case it choses to re-request control with takeover bit set to allow permission, requestor GCS will only have 10 seconds to get control, otherwise owning GCS will re-request control with takeover bit set to disallow permission, and requestor GCS will need repeat the request if still interested in getting control.
          Note that the pilots of both GCS should co-ordinate safe handover offline.

          Note that in most systems the only controlled component will be the "system manager component", and that will be the autopilot.
          However separate GCS control of a particular component is also permitted, if supported by the component.
          In this case the GCS will address MAV_CMD_REQUEST_OPERATOR_CONTROL to the specific component it wants to control.
          The component will then stream CONTROL_STATUS for its controlling GCS (it must not set GCS_CONTROL_STATUS_FLAGS_SYSTEM_MANAGER).
          The component should fall back to the system GCS (if any) when it is not directly controlled, and may stop emitting CONTROL_STATUS.
          The flow is otherwise the same as for requesting control over the whole system.

    <message id="420" name="RADIO_RC_CHANNELS">
      <description>RC channel outputs from a MAVLink RC receiver for input to a flight controller or other components (allows an RC receiver to connect via MAVLink instead of some other protocol such as PPM-Sum or S.BUS).
        Note that this is not intended to be an over-the-air format, and does not replace RC_CHANNELS and similar messages reported by the flight controller.
        The target_system field should normally be set to the system id of the system to control, typically the flight controller.
        The target_component field can normally be set to 0, so that all components of the system can receive the message.
        The channels array field can publish up to 32 channels; the number of channel items used in the array is specified in the count field.
        The time_last_update_ms field contains the timestamp of the last received valid channels data in the receiver's time domain.
        The count field indicates the first index of the channel array that is not used for channel data (this and later indexes are zero-filled).
        The RADIO_RC_CHANNELS_FLAGS_OUTDATED flag is set by the receiver if the channels data is not up-to-date (for example, if new data from the transmitter could not be validated so the last valid data is resent).
        The RADIO_RC_CHANNELS_FLAGS_FAILSAFE failsafe flag is set by the receiver if the receiver's failsafe condition is met (implementation dependent, e.g., connection to the RC radio is lost).
        In this case time_last_update_ms still contains the timestamp of the last valid channels data, but the content of the channels data is not defined by the protocol (it is up to the implementation of the receiver).
        For instance, the channels data could contain failsafe values configured in the receiver; the default is to carry the last valid data.
        Note: The RC channels fields are extensions to ensure that they are located at the end of the serialized payload and subject to MAVLink's trailing-zero trimming.
