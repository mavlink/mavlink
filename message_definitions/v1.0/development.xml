          This might be used to provide an initial wind estimate to the estimator (EKF) in the case where the vehicle is wind dead-reckoning, extending the time when operating without GPS before before position drift builds to an unsafe level. For this use case the command might reasonably be sent every few minutes when operating at altitude, and the value is cleared if the estimator resets itself.

      <description>Checksum for the current mission, rally point or geofence plan, or for the "combined" plan (a GCS can use these checksums to determine if it has matching plans).
        This message must be broadcast with the appropriate checksum following any change to a mission, geofence or rally point definition
        (immediately after the MISSION_ACK that completes the upload sequence).
        It may also be requested using MAV_CMD_REQUEST_MESSAGE, where param 2 indicates the plan type for which the checksum is required.
        The checksum must be calculated on the autopilot, but may also be calculated by the GCS.
        The checksum uses the same CRC32 algorithm as MAVLink FTP (https://mavlink.io/en/services/ftp.html#crc32-implementation).
        The checksum for a mission, geofence or rally point definition is run over each item in the plan in seq order (excluding the home location if present in the plan), and covers the following fields (in order):
        frame, command, autocontinue, param1, param2, param3, param4, param5, param6, param7.
        The checksum for the whole plan (MAV_MISSION_TYPE_ALL) is calculated using the same approach, running over each sub-plan in the following order: mission, geofence then rally point.

    <message id="420" name="RADIO_RC_CHANNELS">
      <description>RC channel outputs from a MAVLink RC receiver for input to a flight controller or other components (allows an RC receiver to connect via MAVLink instead of some other protocol such as PPM-Sum or S.BUS).
        Note that this is not intended to be an over-the-air format, and does not replace RC_CHANNELS and similar messages reported by the flight controller.
        The target_system field should normally be set to the system id of the system to control, typically the flight controller.
        The target_component field can normally be set to 0, so that all components of the system can receive the message.
        The channels array field can publish up to 32 channels; the number of channel items used in the array is specified in the count field.
        The time_last_update_ms field contains the timestamp of the last received valid channels data in the receiver's time domain.
        The count field indicates the first index of the channel array that is not used for channel data (this and later indexes are zero-filled).
        The RADIO_RC_CHANNELS_FLAGS_OUTDATED flag is set by the receiver if the channels data is not up-to-date (for example, if new data from the transmitter could not be validated so the last valid data is resent).
        The RADIO_RC_CHANNELS_FLAGS_FAILSAFE failsafe flag is set by the receiver if the receiver's failsafe condition is met (implementation dependent, e.g., connection to the RC radio is lost).
        In this case time_last_update_ms still contains the timestamp of the last valid channels data, but the content of the channels data is not defined by the protocol (it is up to the implementation of the receiver).
        For instance, the channels data could contain failsafe values configured in the receiver; the default is to carry the last valid data.
        Note: The RC channels fields are extensions to ensure that they are located at the end of the serialized payload and subject to MAVLink's trailing-zero trimming.
